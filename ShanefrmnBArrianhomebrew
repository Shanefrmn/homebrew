Mojo himself is quite a chatterbox with an alcohol problem, and his hard head can be used as a {@dice 1d4} bludgeon when held in the off-hand. The Witch Doctor’s Mojo acts as a Tome (Warlock’s Pact of Tome), allowing the bearer to choose three cantrips from any class’ spell list. While the Mojo is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They do not count against your number of cantrips known. ",

You can now put your Mojo to work memorizing any manner of magical rituals you happen to come across in your adventures, so long as they are less than or equal to half your Witch Doctor level (rounded up). It takes two hours per spell level of rigorous repetition to permanently pound a new ritual into Mojo’s tiny head, as well as 50gp for the necessary alcohol required to bribe him into cooperating. Choose two 1st-level ritual spells from any spell list: those rituals—and any you are able to teach Mojo down the road—are permanently castable, without taking up a spell slot or a ‘spells known’ slot.
